Phase III: Logical Database Design Documentation

Objective: Design a detailed logical data model for the Microloan Management System, ensuring the design meets at least the Third Normal Form (3NF) and includes a complete data dictionary.




Deliverable: GitHub submission including the ER Diagram, Data Dictionary, and Assumptions.

1. Entity-Relationship Model (ERM) Summary
The Microloan Management System (MMS) is modeled around three core entities: Clients, Loans, and Payments.

Entity	
Purpose 

Primary Key (PK)
Clients	Stores registration and biographical details for micro-entrepreneurs.	client_id
Loans	Records the details of the specific loan contract, including amount and schedule.	loan_id
Payments	Logs every repayment transaction made against a specific loan.	payment_id

Export to Sheets

Relationships & Cardinalities
Clients to Loans:

Relationship: A Client applies for and receives one or more Loans.

Cardinality: One-to-Many (1:M).

Implementation: Loans.client_id is a Foreign Key referencing Clients.client_id.

Loans to Payments:

Relationship: A Loan receives one or more Payments until the debt is settled.

Cardinality: One-to-Many (1:M).

Implementation: Payments.loan_id is a Foreign Key referencing Loans.loan_id.

2. Normalization Justification
The logical design for the MMS adheres to the Third Normal Form (3NF).

Normal Form	Requirement	How the MMS Schema Meets It

1NF (First Normal Form) 

All attribute values are atomic (single-valued), and there are no repeating groups.	All attributes (name, amount, payment_date, etc.) are single-valued. All tables have a primary key (client_id, loan_id, payment_id).

2NF (Second Normal Form) 

Must be in 1NF, and all non-key attributes must be fully dependent on the entire Primary Key.	All tables use simple Primary Keys, eliminating the possibility of partial dependency (e.g., client_id determines name entirely).

3NF (Third Normal Form) 

Must be in 2NF, and no non-key attribute can be dependent on another non-key attribute (eliminating transitive dependencies).	Non-key fields like Client.name are only determined by Client.client_id. They are not dependent on any other non-key field. This structure ensures business details (business_type) and loan details (interest_rate) are stored only once.



3. Data Dictionary
This table details the attributes, data types (using Oracle standards for Phase V implementation), constraints, and purpose for each column in the logical model.

Table	Column Name	Oracle Data Type	Constraints	Purpose
Clients	client_id	NUMBER(10)	PK, NOT NULL	Unique identifier for the client (Auto-generated by sequence).
name	VARCHAR2(100)	NOT NULL	Full name of the client/business owner.
contact	VARCHAR2(20)	UNIQUE, NOT NULL	Primary contact number/email address.
business_type	VARCHAR2(50)	NOT NULL	Category of the micro-business (e.g., Retail, Service, Agriculture).
Loans	loan_id	NUMBER(10)	PK, NOT NULL	Unique identifier for the loan (Auto-generated by sequence).
client_id	NUMBER(10)	FK to Clients (client_id), NOT NULL	Links the loan to the borrowing client.
amount	NUMBER(12, 2)	NOT NULL, CHECK ( > 0)	The principal amount disbursed.
interest_rate	NUMBER(5, 4)	NOT NULL, CHECK (BETWEEN 0 AND 1)	Annual interest rate (e.g., 0.15 for 15%).
start_date	DATE	NOT NULL	The date the loan was disbursed.
due_date	DATE	NOT NULL	The final repayment date.
Payments	payment_id	NUMBER(10)	PK, NOT NULL	Unique transaction ID (Auto-generated by sequence).
loan_id	NUMBER(10)	FK to Loans (loan_id), NOT NULL	Links the payment to the specific loan.
amount_paid	NUMBER(12, 2)	NOT NULL, CHECK ( > 0)	The amount received in the transaction.
payment_date	DATE	NOT NULL	The date the payment was recorded.


4. Design Assumptions
The following assumptions were made to finalize the logical design:

Single Repayment Stream: It is assumed that each payment applies entirely to a single loan. Payments are not split across multiple loans.

Unique Clients: The combination of name and contact information is assumed to be sufficient to uniquely identify a client, though client_id is the technical Primary Key.

Simple Interest Calculation: The system assumes a relatively straightforward interest and penalty calculation methodology, typically based on the remaining principal balance. The detailed calculation logic will be entirely handled by PL/SQL procedures and triggers (Phases VI and VII).


No Multi-Currency: All monetary values (amount, amount_paid) are stored in a single implied currency (e.g., USD, RWF).

Fixed Interest Rate: The interest_rate is assumed to be fixed for the duration of the loan once the loan record is created.
